# second-data-science-project
## first part: Fashion Mnist 
In this part of the project we were required to identify images of clothes by using pixels. 
So in order to reduce the problem we used PCA so that instead of processing 784 pixels it processed only 100.
To predict the clothes in the testing set we used different algorithms:
simple models like KNN , logistic regression, SVC.. 
and some ensemble learning models like voting classifier, random forest and adaBoost.
